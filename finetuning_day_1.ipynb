( see further discussion in this item 7 under liquidity and capital resources 2013 capital plan. ) f0b7 positive train control 2013 in response to a legislative mandate to implement ptc by the end of

with implementing rules issued by the federal rail administration ( fra ) , will cost us approximately $ 2 billion by the end of the project . this includes costs for installing the new system along our tracks , upgrading locomotives to work with the new system , and adding digital data communication equipment to integrate the various components of the system and achieve interoperability for the industry . although it is unlikely that the rail industry will meet the current mandatory 2015 deadline ( as the fra indicated in its 2012 report to congress ) , we are making a good faith effort to

\"Please answer the given financial question based on the context.\\nContext: adobe systems incorporated notes to consolidated financial statements ( continued ) we review our goodwill for impairment annually , or more frequently , if facts and circumstances warrant a review . we completed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 . we elected to use the step 1 quantitative assessment for our reporting units and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill . there is no significant risk of material goodwill impairment in any of our reporting units , based upon the results of our annual goodwill impairment test . we amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives and review them for impairment whenever an impairment indicator exists . we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of our long-lived assets , including our intangible assets may not be recoverable . when such events or changes in circumstances occur , we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the undiscounted expected future cash flows . if the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets , we recognize an impairment loss based on any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets . we did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2014 , 2013 or 2012 . our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 1 to 14 years . amortization is based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset will be consumed or on a straight-line basis when the consumption pattern is not apparent . the weighted average useful lives of our intangible assets were as follows : weighted average useful life ( years ) .\\n||weighted averageuseful life ( years )|\\n|purchased technology|6|\\n|customer contracts and

software to be sold , leased , or otherwise marketed begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility , which is generally the completion of a working prototype that has been certified as having no critical bugs and is a release candidate . amortization begins once the software is ready for its intended use , generally based on the pattern in which the economic benefits will be consumed . to date , software development costs incurred between completion of a working prototype and general availability of the related product have not been material . internal use software we capitalize costs associated with customized internal-use software systems that have reached the application development stage . such capitalized costs include external direct costs utilized in developing or obtaining the applications and payroll and payroll-related expenses for employees , who are directly associated with the development of the applications . capitalization of such costs begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and ceases at the point in which the project is substantially complete and is ready for its intended purpose . income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes . under this method , income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year . in addition , deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities , and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards . we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount for which realization is more likely than not . taxes collected from customers we net taxes collected from customers against those remitted to government authorities in our financial statements . accordingly , taxes collected from customers are not reported as revenue. .\\nQuestion: what is

I know there's a formula for this. It's like, finding the difference between the final value and the initial value. Yeah, that's right!\\nSo, I need to subtract $100.00 from $119.89. Hmm, that leaves me with $19.89. That\\u2019s the gain over the year.\\nOkay, but I need to know the rate of return, not just the gain. To do that, I need to see what that gain represents as a fraction of the original investment.\\nLet\\u2019s see, I'll divide $19.89 by $100.00. It's 0.1989 in decimal form.\\nNow, to express that as a percentage, I'll multiply by 100. Oh! That gives me 19.89%.\\nAh, got it! The rate of return for UPS from 2002 to 2003 is 19.89%. Makes sense now. Let me just double-check... yep, all the numbers add up correctly. We're good!\",\n          \"Alright, so we're looking at how to figure out the net income margin for 2015. Let's break that down. First off, net income margin is basically how much profit a company makes from its sales. So, we need to take the net income and divide it by net sales. Easy enough, right? And then we multiply by 100 to get a percentage because percentages are easier to understand at a glance. \\n\\nNow, checking the numbers they've provided: The net earnings, which is the same as net income, is $3,534 million. Got it. Net sales are $45,366 million. So those are our two main numbers. \\n\\nNext step: doing the math. I need to divide the net income, which is $3,534, by the net sales, $45,366. Let me punch those numbers into a calculator real quick. Oh, okay, that comes out to about 0.0779. \\n\\nNow to express it as a percentage, I'll multiply it by 100. So, 0.0779 times 100... and that gives us 7.79%. \\n\\nAlright, looking at everything, the net income margin for 2015 is indeed about 7.79%. I'll just double-check my math to be sure \\u2013 dividing $3,534 by $45,366 again, yes, and multiplying by 100. Yep, still 7.79%. So everything checks out!\",\n          \"Okay, let's dive into this question. I need to find out what the total undiscounted capital lease obligations would be if we don't include the assets that are still under construction. \\n\\nFirst, I'll look at the information that's been given. The total minimum lease payments for capital leases are $657 million, which seems to cover everything as of December 31, 2008. \\n\\nBut wait, it says here that out of that total, $335 million relates specifically to assets that are still under construction. Hmm, so this means I need to subtract this amount from the total to get what is really being asked for \\u2014 obligations excluding construction assets. \\n\\nLet's do the quick math: $657 million minus $335 million. A little simple subtraction here and, oh, that leaves me with $322 million. \\n\\nSo, $322 million is what we have left, representing the total undiscounted minimum capital lease obligations, once we put aside those under-construction assets. \\n\\nJust to be sure, that's definitely what I was looking for \\u2014 subtracting the portion for construction assets from the overall total to isolate just the obligations without them. Everything checks out, and that $322 million makes perfect sense.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Response\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5489,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The total dollar amount of new stock options issued to employees on October 22, 2003, was $152,432,095.68.

            "First, let's start with Global Payments. We initially put in $100, and by the end of 2017, that investment is worth $474.52. To find out how much it's grown, we'll subtract our initial $100 from $474.52. That gives us $374.52.\n",

            "Okay, so now we take that growth amount, $374.52, and see what percentage it represents of our initial $100 investment.

( see further discussion in this item 7 under liquidity and capital resources 2013 capital plan. ) f0b7 positive train control 2013 in response to a legislative mandate to implement ptc by the end of 2015 , we have invested $ 1.2 billion in capital expenditures and plan to spend an additional $ 450 million during 2014 on developing and deploying ptc . we currently estimate that ptc , in accordance with implementing rules issued by the federal rail administration ( fra ) , will cost us approximately $ 2 billion by the end of the project . this includes costs for installing the new system along our tracks , upgrading locomotives to work with the new system , and adding digital data communication equipment to integrate the various components of the system and achieve interoperability for the industry . although it is unlikely that the rail industry will meet the current mandatory 2015 deadline ( as the fra indicated in its 2012 report to congress ) , we are making a good faith effort to

\"Please answer the given financial question based on the context.\\nContext: adobe systems incorporated notes to consolidated financial statements ( continued ) we review our goodwill for impairment annually , or more frequently , if facts and circumstances warrant a review . we completed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 . we elected to use the step 1 quantitative assessment for our reporting units and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill . there is no significant risk of material goodwill impairment in any of our reporting units , based upon the results of our annual goodwill impairment test . we amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives and review them for impairment whenever an impairment indicator exists . we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of our long-lived assets , including our intangible assets may not be recoverable . when such events or changes in circumstances occur , we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the undiscounted expected future cash flows . if the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets , we recognize an impairment loss based on any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets . we did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2014 , 2013 or 2012 . our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 1 to 14 years . amortization is based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset will be consumed or on a straight-line basis when the consumption pattern is not apparent . the weighted average useful lives of our intangible assets were as follows : weighted average useful life ( years ) .\\n||weighted averageuseful life ( years )|\\n|purchased technology|6|\\n|customer contracts and

software to be sold , leased , or otherwise marketed begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility , which is generally the completion of a working prototype that has been certified as having no critical bugs and is a release candidate . amortization begins once the software is ready for its intended use , generally based on the pattern in which the economic benefits will be consumed . to date , software development costs incurred between completion of a working prototype and general availability of the related product have not been material . internal use software we capitalize costs associated with customized internal-use software systems that have reached the application development stage . such capitalized costs include external direct costs utilized in developing or obtaining the applications and payroll and payroll-related expenses for employees , who are directly associated with the development of the applications . capitalization of such costs begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and ceases at the point in which the project is substantially complete and is ready for its intended purpose . income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes . under this method , income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year . in addition , deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities , and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards . we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount for which realization is more likely than not . taxes collected from customers we net taxes collected from customers against those remitted to government authorities in our financial statements . accordingly , taxes collected from customers are not reported as revenue. .\\nQuestion: what is

We're looking at a UPS investment starting with $100.00 in 2002. By 2003, that investment grew to $119.89. Interesting.\\nLet me figure out how much the return was over that year. I know there's a formula for this. It's like, finding the difference between the final value and the initial value. Yeah, that's right!\\nSo, I need to subtract $100.00 from $119.89. Hmm, that leaves me with $19.89. That\\u2019s the gain over the year.\\nOkay, but I need to know the rate of return, not just the gain. To do that, I need to see what that gain represents as a fraction of the original investment.\\nLet\\u2019s see, I'll divide $19.89 by $100.00. It's 0.1989 in decimal form.\\nNow, to express that as a percentage, I'll multiply by 100. Oh! That gives me 19.89%.\\nAh, got it! The rate of return for UPS from 2002 to 2003 is 19.89%. Makes sense now. Let me just double-check... yep, all the numbers add up correctly. We're good!\",\n          \"Alright, so we're looking at how to figure out the net income margin for 2015. Let's break that down. First off, net income margin is basically how much profit a company makes from its sales. So, we need to take the net income and divide it by net sales. Easy enough, right? And then we multiply by 100 to get a percentage because percentages are easier to understand at a glance. \\n\\nNow, checking the numbers they've provided: The net earnings, which is the same as net income, is $3,534 million. Got it. Net sales are $45,366 million. So those are our two main numbers. \\n\\nNext step: doing the math. I need to divide the net income, which is $3,534, by the net sales, $45,366. Let me punch those numbers into a calculator real quick. Oh, okay, that comes out to about 0.0779. \\n\\nNow to express it as a percentage, I'll multiply it by 100. So, 0.0779 times 100... and that gives us 7.79%. \\n\\nAlright, looking at everything, the net income margin for 2015 is indeed about 7.79%. I'll just double-check my math to be sure \\u2013 dividing $3,534 by $45,366 again, yes, and multiplying by 100. Yep, still 7.79%. So everything checks out!\",\n          \"Okay, let's dive into this question. I need to find out what the total undiscounted capital lease obligations would be if we don't include the assets that are still under construction. \\n\\nFirst, I'll look at the information that's been given. The total minimum lease payments for capital leases are $657 million, which seems to cover everything as of December 31, 2008. \\n\\nBut wait, it says here that out of that total, $335 million relates specifically to assets that are still under construction. Hmm, so this means I need to subtract this amount from the total to get what is really being asked for \\u2014 obligations excluding construction assets. \\n\\nLet's do the quick math: $657 million minus $335 million. A little simple subtraction here and, oh, that leaves me with $322 million. \\n\\nSo, $322 million is what we have left, representing the total undiscounted minimum capital lease obligations, once we put aside those under-construction assets. \\n\\nJust to be sure, that's definitely what I was looking for \\u2014 subtracting the portion for construction assets from the overall total to isolate just the obligations without them.

\"Please answer the given financial question based on the context.\\nContext: adobe systems incorporated notes to consolidated financial statements ( continued ) we review our goodwill for impairment annually , or more frequently , if facts and circumstances warrant a review . we completed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 . we elected to use the step 1 quantitative assessment for our reporting units and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill . there is no significant risk of material goodwill impairment in any of our reporting units , based upon the results of our annual goodwill impairment test . we amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives and review them for impairment whenever an impairment indicator exists . we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of our long-lived assets , including our intangible assets may not be recoverable . when such events or changes in circumstances occur , we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the undiscounted expected future cash flows . if the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets , we recognize an impairment loss based on any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets . we did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2014 , 2013 or 2012 . our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 1 to 14 years . amortization is based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset will be consumed or on a straight-line basis when the consumption pattern is not apparent . the weighted average useful lives of our intangible assets were as follows : weighted average useful life ( years ) .\\n||weighted averageuseful life ( years )|\\n|purchased technology|6|\\n|customer contracts and

software to be sold , leased , or otherwise marketed begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility , which is generally the completion of a working prototype that has been certified as having no critical bugs and is a release candidate . amortization begins once the software is ready for its intended use , generally based on the pattern in which the economic benefits will be consumed . to date , software development costs incurred between completion of a working prototype and general availability of the related product have not been material . internal use software we capitalize costs associated with customized internal-use software systems that have reached the application development stage . such capitalized costs include external direct costs utilized in developing or obtaining the applications and payroll and payroll-related expenses for employees , who are directly associated with the development of the applications . capitalization of such costs begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and ceases at the point in which the project is substantially complete and is ready for its intended purpose . income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes . under this method , income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year . in addition , deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities , and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards . we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount for which realization is more likely than not . taxes collected from customers we net taxes

We're looking at a UPS investment starting with $100.00 in 2002. By 2003, that investment grew to $119.89. Interesting.\\nLet me figure out how much the return was over that year. I know there's a formula for this. It's like, finding the difference between the final value and the initial value. Yeah, that's right!\\nSo, I need to subtract $100.00 from $119.89. Hmm, that leaves me with $19.89. That\\u2019s the gain over the year.\\nOkay, but I need to know the rate of return, not just the gain. To do that, I need to see what that gain represents as a fraction of the original investment.\\nLet\\u2019s see, I'll divide $19.89 by $100.00. It's 0.1989 in decimal form.\\nNow, to express that as a percentage, I'll multiply by 100. Oh! That gives me 19.89%.\\nAh, got it! The rate of return for UPS from 2002 to 2003 is 19.89%. Makes sense now. Let me just double-check... yep, all the numbers add up correctly. We're good!\",\n          \"Alright, so we're looking at how to figure out the net income margin for 2015. Let's break that down. First off, net income margin is basically how much profit a company makes from its sales. So, we need to take the net income and divide it by net sales. Easy enough, right? And then we multiply by 100 to get a percentage because percentages are easier to understand at a glance. \\n\\nNow, checking the numbers they've provided: The net earnings, which is the same as net income, is $3,534 million. Got it. Net sales are $45,366 million. So those are our two main numbers. \\n\\nNext step: doing the math. I need to divide the net income, which is $3,534, by the net sales, $45,366. Let me punch those numbers into a calculator real quick. Oh, okay, that comes out to about 0.0779. \\n\\nNow to express it as a percentage, I'll multiply it by 100. So, 0.0779 times 100... and that gives us 7.79%. \\n\\nAlright, looking at everything, the net income margin for 2015 is indeed about 7.79%. I'll just double-check my math to be sure \\u2013 dividing $3,534 by $45,366 again, yes, and multiplying by 100. Yep, still 7.79%. So everything checks out!\",\n          \"Okay, let's dive into this question. I need to find out what the total undiscounted capital lease obligations would be if we don't include the assets that are still under construction. \\n\\nFirst, I'll look at the information that's been given. The total minimum lease payments for capital leases are $657 million, which seems to cover everything as of December 31, 2008. \\n\\nBut wait, it says here that out of that total, $335 million relates specifically to assets that are still under construction. Hmm, so this means I need to subtract this amount from the total to get what is really being asked for \\u2014 obligations excluding construction assets. \\n\\nLet's do the quick math: $657 million minus $335 million. A little simple subtraction here and, oh, that leaves me with $322 million. \\n\\nSo, $322 million is what we have left, representing the total undiscounted minimum capital lease obligations, once we put aside those under-construction assets. \\n\\nJust to be sure, that's definitely what I was looking for \\u2014 subtracting the portion for construction assets from the overall total to isolate just the obligations without them. Everything checks out, and that $322 million makes perfect sense.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Response\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5489,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The total dollar amount of new stock options issued to employees on October 22, 2003, was $152,432,095.68.

\"Please answer the given financial question based on the context.\\nContext: adobe systems incorporated notes to consolidated financial statements ( continued ) we review our goodwill for impairment annually , or more frequently , if facts and circumstances warrant a review . we completed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 . we elected to use the step 1 quantitative assessment for our reporting units and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill . there is no significant risk of material goodwill impairment in any of our reporting units , based upon the results of our annual goodwill impairment test . we amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives and review them for impairment whenever an impairment indicator exists . we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of our long-lived assets , including our intangible assets may not be recoverable . when such events or changes in circumstances occur , we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the undiscounted expected future cash flows . if the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets , we recognize an impairment loss based on any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets . we did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2014 , 2013 or 2012 . our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 1 to 14 years . amortization is based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset will be consumed or on a straight-line basis when the consumption pattern is not apparent . the weighted average useful lives of our intangible assets were as follows : weighted average useful life ( years ) .\\n||weighted averageuseful life ( years )|\\n|purchased technology|6|\\n|customer contracts and

software to be sold , leased , or otherwise marketed begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility , which is generally the completion of a working prototype that has been certified as having no critical bugs and is a release candidate . amortization begins once the software is ready for its intended use , generally based on the pattern in which the economic benefits will be consumed . to date , software development costs incurred between completion of a working prototype and general availability of the related product have not been material . internal use software we capitalize costs associated with customized internal-use software systems that have reached the application development stage . such capitalized costs include external direct costs utilized in developing or obtaining the applications and payroll and payroll-related expenses for employees , who are directly associated with the development of the applications . capitalization of such costs begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and ceases at the point in which the project is substantially complete and is ready for its intended purpose . income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes . under this method , income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year . in addition , deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities , and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards . we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount for which realization is more likely than not . taxes collected from customers we net taxes

We're looking at a UPS investment starting with $100.00 in 2002. By 2003, that investment grew to $119.89. Interesting.\\nLet me figure out how much the return was over that year. I know there's a formula for this. It's like, finding the difference between the final value and the initial value. Yeah, that's right!\\nSo, I need to subtract $100.00 from $119.89. Hmm, that leaves me with $19.89. That\\u2019s the gain over the year.\\nOkay, but I need to know the rate of return, not just the gain. To do that, I need to see what that gain represents as a fraction of the original investment.\\nLet\\u2019s see, I'll divide $19.89 by $100.00. It's 0.1989 in decimal form.\\nNow, to express that as a percentage, I'll multiply by 100. Oh! That gives me 19.89%.\\nAh, got it! The rate of return for UPS from 2002 to 2003 is 19.89%. Makes sense now. Let me just double-check... yep, all the numbers add up correctly. We're good!\",\n          \"Alright, so we're looking at how to figure out the net income margin for 2015. Let's break that down. First off, net income margin is basically how much profit a company makes from its sales. So, we need to take the net income and divide it by net sales. Easy enough, right? And then we multiply by 100 to get a percentage because percentages are easier to understand at a glance. \\n\\nNow, checking the numbers they've provided: The net earnings, which is the same as net income, is $3,534 million. Got it. Net sales are $45,366 million. So those are our two main numbers. \\n\\nNext step: doing the math. I need to divide the net income, which is $3,534, by the net sales, $45,366. Let me punch those numbers into a calculator real quick. Oh, okay, that comes out to about 0.0779. \\n\\nNow to express it as a percentage, I'll multiply it by 100. So, 0.0779 times 100... and that gives us 7.79%. \\n\\nAlright, looking at everything, the net income margin for 2015 is indeed about 7.79%. I'll just double-check my math to be sure \\u2013 dividing $3,534 by $45,366 again, yes, and multiplying by 100. Yep, still 7.79%. So everything checks out!\",\n          \"Okay, let's dive into this question. I need to find out what the total undiscounted capital lease obligations would be if we don't include the assets that are still under construction. \\n\\nFirst, I'll look at the information that's been given. The total minimum lease payments for capital leases are $657 million, which seems to cover everything as of December 31, 2008. \\n\\nBut wait, it says here that out of that total, $335 million relates specifically to assets that are still under construction. Hmm, so this means I need to subtract this amount from the total to get what is really being asked for \\u2014 obligations excluding construction assets. \\n\\nLet's do the quick math: $657 million minus $335 million. A little simple subtraction here and, oh, that leaves me with $322 million. \\n\\nSo, $322 million is what we have left, representing the total undiscounted minimum capital lease obligations, once we put aside those under-construction assets. \\n\\nJust to be sure, that's definitely what I was looking for \\u2014 subtracting the portion for construction assets from the overall total to isolate just the obligations without them.

The calculation is as follows:\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\text{Percentage} = \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\text{Prepaid Income Tax}}{\\\\text{Total Prepaid and Other Current Assets}} \\\\right) \\\\times 100 \\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\text{Percentage} = \\\\left( \\\\frac{57,665}{222,851} \\\\right) \\\\times 100 \\\\approx 25.9\\\\% \\\\]\\n\\nTherefore, in 2012, tax-related assets were approximately 25.9% of the total current assets and prepaids.\",\n          \"The percent change in net earnings attributable to Altria Group, Inc. from 2016 to 2017 is a decrease of approximately 28.21%.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

I see here that the total number of shares bought under announced plans was 2,878,673.\\nHmm, now let's move on to December 2014. In December, the number of shares purchased as part of those plans was quite a bit higher, at 5,117,774.\\nI need to figure out how many more shares were purchased in December compared to October. To do that, I'll just subtract the October shares from the December shares.\\nSo, it's 5,117,774 minus 2,878,673. Let me calculate that real quick.\\nAh, the result comes out to be 2,239,101. This is how many more shares were purchased in December than in October.\\nJust to be sure, I'll double-check this. Yep, doing the subtraction again confirms it: 5,117,774 minus 2,878,673 is definitely 2,239,101.\\nAlright, so in conclusion, compared to October 2014, there were 2,239,101 more shares purchased as part of publicly announced plans in December 2014.\",\n          \"So, I'm trying to figure out the average size of the data centers as of 2016. Let's see, they're saying there are 8 data centers in total. I should keep that number in mind.\\n\\nNow, how big are they altogether? Ah, here it is\\u2014600,000 square feet combined for all those data centers.\\n\\nTo find out the average size per data center, I just need to divide this total size by the number of data centers. Okay, math time: 600,000 divided by 8.\\n\\nLet's do the math: 600,000 divided by 8 gives me a nice round number. Hmm, the result is 75,000.\\n\\nSo, each data center, on average, is about 75,000 square feet in size.\\n\\nYeah, this makes sense, because the context provided these figures precisely. Eight centers sharing 600,000 square feet indeed leads to each having 75,000 square feet.\\n\\nLooks like everything adds up well, giving a solid conclusion that the average size of each data center is 75,000 square feet as of 2016.\",\n          \"Alright, let's sort through these numbers and figure out the change in service costs from 2017 to 2018.\\n\\nFirst, we have to find the service cost for both years. Hmm, for 2017, it looks like the service cost is $110 million. For 2018, it's listed as $136 million.\\n\\nNow let's see how much that went up. We need to get the difference between these two figures. So, if I subtract 2017's $110 million from 2018's $136 million, I get $26 million. That's the increase in service costs over the year.\\n\\nNext, let's turn that increase into a percentage so we can better understand the scale of it. We want to compare the $26 million increase to the 2017 amount, $110 million, as a base. To do this, we'll divide the increase, $26 million, by the 2017 cost, $110 million.\\n\\nWhen we divide $26 million by $110 million, we end up with about 0.2364. Multiplying by 100 turns this into a percentage. So, $26 million is approximately 23.64% of $110 million.\\n\\nOh, so after running the numbers, it turns out that from 2017 to 2018, the service costs went up by roughly 23.64%.

\"Please answer the given financial question based on the context.\\nContext: adobe systems incorporated notes to consolidated financial statements ( continued ) we review our goodwill for impairment annually , or more frequently , if facts and circumstances warrant a review . we completed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 . we elected to use the step 1 quantitative assessment for our reporting units and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill . there is no significant risk of material goodwill impairment in any of our reporting units , based upon the results of our annual goodwill impairment test . we amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives and review them for impairment whenever an impairment indicator exists . we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of our long-lived assets , including our intangible assets may not be recoverable . when such events or changes in circumstances occur , we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the undiscounted expected future cash flows . if the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets , we recognize an impairment loss based on any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets . we did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2014 , 2013 or 2012 . our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 1 to 14 years . amortization is based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset will be consumed or on a straight-line basis when the consumption pattern is not apparent . the weighted average useful lives of our intangible assets were as follows : weighted average useful life ( years ) .\\n||weighted averageuseful life ( years )|\\n|purchased technology|6|\\n|customer contracts and

software to be sold , leased , or otherwise marketed begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility , which is generally the completion of a working prototype that has been certified as having no critical bugs and is a release candidate . amortization begins once the software is ready for its intended use , generally based on the pattern in which the economic benefits will be consumed . to date , software development costs incurred between completion of a working prototype and general availability of the related product have not been material . internal use software we capitalize costs associated with customized internal-use software systems that have reached the application development stage . such capitalized costs include external direct costs utilized in developing or obtaining the applications and payroll and payroll-related expenses for employees , who are directly associated with the development of the applications . capitalization of such costs begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and ceases at the point in which the project is substantially complete and is ready for its intended purpose . income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes . under this method , income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year . in addition , deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities , and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards . we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount for which realization is more likely than not . taxes collected from customers we net taxes

We're looking at a UPS investment starting with $100.00 in 2002. By 2003, that investment grew to $119.89. Interesting.\\nLet me figure out how much the return was over that year. I know there's a formula for this. It's like, finding the difference between the final value and the initial value. Yeah, that's right!\\nSo, I need to subtract $100.00 from $119.89. Hmm, that leaves me with $19.89. That\\u2019s the gain over the year.\\nOkay, but I need to know the rate of return, not just the gain. To do that, I need to see what that gain represents as a fraction of the original investment.\\nLet\\u2019s see, I'll divide $19.89 by $100.00. It's 0.1989 in decimal form.\\nNow, to express that as a percentage, I'll multiply by 100. Oh! That gives me 19.89%.\\nAh, got it! The rate of return for UPS from 2002 to 2003 is 19.89%. Makes sense now. Let me just double-check... yep, all the numbers add up correctly. We're good!\",\n          \"Alright, so we're looking at how to figure out the net income margin for 2015. Let's break that down. First off, net income margin is basically how much profit a company makes from its sales. So, we need to take the net income and divide it by net sales. Easy enough, right? And then we multiply by 100 to get a percentage because percentages are easier to understand at a glance. \\n\\nNow, checking the numbers they've provided: The net earnings, which is the same as net income, is $3,534 million. Got it. Net sales are $45,366 million. So those are our two main numbers. \\n\\nNext step: doing the math. I need to divide the net income, which is $3,534, by the net sales, $45,366. Let me punch those numbers into a calculator real quick. Oh, okay, that comes out to about 0.0779. \\n\\nNow to express it as a percentage, I'll multiply it by 100. So, 0.0779 times 100... and that gives us 7.79%. \\n\\nAlright, looking at everything, the net income margin for 2015 is indeed about 7.79%. I'll just double-check my math to be sure \\u2013 dividing $3,534 by $45,366 again, yes, and multiplying by 100. Yep, still 7.79%. So everything checks out!\",\n          \"Okay, let's dive into this question. I need to find out what the total undiscounted capital lease obligations would be if we don't include the assets that are still under construction. \\n\\nFirst, I'll look at the information that's been given. The total minimum lease payments for capital leases are $657 million, which seems to cover everything as of December 31, 2008. \\n\\nBut wait, it says here that out of that total, $335 million relates specifically to assets that are still under construction. Hmm, so this means I need to subtract this amount from the total to get what is really being asked for \\u2014 obligations excluding construction assets. \\n\\nLet's do the quick math: $657 million minus $335 million. A little simple subtraction here and, oh, that leaves me with $322 million. \\n\\nSo, $322 million is what we have left, representing the total undiscounted minimum capital lease obligations, once we put aside those under-construction assets. \\n\\nJust to be sure, that's definitely what I was looking for \\u2014 subtracting the portion for construction assets from the overall total to isolate just the obligations without them.

              " 'input': 'Alright, let s figure out what we need here. We want to find the ratio of cash provided by operating activities to the purchases of property and equipment for 2015. So, first things first, we need to pinpoint those two numbers from the data. Looking at 2015, it says cash provided by operating activities was $1679.7 million. Okay, got that. Next up, let s find out how much was spent on purchasing property and equipment in the same year. It shows 2015 s purchases totaled $945.6 million. Now I ve got both crucial numbers  $1679.7 million and $945.6 million. Now that we have the numbers, we need to set up the ratio. This means we are comparing $1679.7 million to $945.6 million. So, we ll take the amount of operating cash, $1679.7 million, and divide it by the purchases, which was $945.6 million. Performing that division should give us our answer. Let s see, doing the math   we divide 1679.7 by 945.6. Okay, and that comes out to around 1.776. So there we have it. The ratio of cash provided by operating activities to purchases of property and equipment in 2015 is approximately 1.776. Let s just confirm that s right by doing the division again quickly... Yep, still around 1.776. Looks like everything checks out ',\n",

Question  what portion of the estimated amortization expense will be recognized in 2017  Answer ', 'input': 'Alright, let s dive into this question about amortization expenses. First, I need to identify the table that illustrates the estimated amortization expenses from 2017 onwards. It looks like this table is super important in figuring out the expense for 2017. Okay, found it  The table clearly states that the estimated amortization expense for the year 2017 is $10,509, but it notes that this is in thousands. Let me think for a second. If the numbers are in thousands, that means I need to convert that $10,509 into actual dollars, which becomes $10,509,000. Easy enough, I just multiply by a thousand. I need to make sure this is consistent throughout. Let me double-check if there s any other information that throws a wrench in this conversion... Nope, everything seems straightforward here. So, what s the conclusion  The amortization expense for 2017 is a clear-cut $10,509,000. Hmm, that makes sense based on the conversion from thousands of dollars, and it looks like there aren t any surprise twists or exceptions here. But hold up, let me consider the perspective of portions. The context refers to percentages or parts, and for that, I should be thinking about the total amortization expense. The whole amount listed is $58,370,000 for all the intangible assets. To find out what part of the total this 2017 expense represents, I ll calculate a ratio. So, I divide $10,509,000 by the grand total, $58,370,000. Crunching these numbers gives me around 0.18004. So, in conclusion, the portion of the total estimated amortization expense that is specifically for 2017 is approximately 0.18004 of the total. I m confident that s correct since that ratio aligns perfectly with the expectation of finding a portion or part. Phew, that should do it ', 'output': 'To determine the portion of the estimated amortization expense that will be recognized in 2017, we first examine the table provided.

Question  how many more shares were purchased as part of publicly announced plans in december 2014 than october 2014  Answer ', 'input': 'Alright, let s start by looking at the numbers for the shares purchased in October 2014. I see here that the total number of shares bought under announced plans was 2,878,673. Hmm, now let s move on to December 2014. In December, the number of shares purchased as part of those plans was quite a bit higher, at 5,117,774. I need to figure out how many more shares were purchased in December compared to October. To do that, I ll just subtract the October shares from the December shares. So, it s 5,117,774 minus 2,878,673. Let me calculate that real quick. Ah, the result comes out to be 2,239,101.

Question  what is the percentage increase in service costs from 2017 to 2018  Answer ', 'input': 'Alright, let s sort through these numbers and figure out the change in service costs from 2017 to 2018. First, we have to find the service COST for both years. Hmm, for 2017, it looks like the service COST is $110 million. For 2018, it s listed as $136 million. Now let s see how much that went up. We need to get the difference between these two figures. So, if I subtract 2017 s $110 million from 2018 s $136 million, I get $26 million. That s the increase in service costs over the year. Next, let s turn that increase into a percentage so we can better understand the scale of it. We want to compare the $26 million increase to the 2017 amount, $110 million, as a base. To do this, we ll divide the increase, $26 million, by the 2017 COST, $110 million. When we divide $26 million by $110 million, we end up with about 0.2364. Multiplying by 100 turns this into a percentage. So, $26 million is approximately 23.64% of $110 million. Oh, so after running the numbers, it turns out that from 2017 to 2018, the service costs went up by roughly 23.64%. Yeah, that makes sense given the data at hand.', 'output': 'The percentage increase in service costs from 2017 to 2018 is approximately 23.64%.', 'metadata': {'text_length': 3728, 'word_count': 656, 'revenue_mentions': []}}\n",

Question  what percent of the leases was paid off in 2016  Answer ', 'input': 'Alright, let s figure out what percentage of the total lease payments was taken care of in 2016. First, I m noticing from the data that the total future minimum rental payments under long-term operating leases add up to $59,488. That s quite a sum in total. Now, focusing specifically on the payments for 2016, it seems that amount is $21,780. So, what I need to do is find out what portion of the total $59,488 was paid in 2016. To do this, I think it s just a matter of dividing the 2016 payments by the total and then converting that fraction into a percentage. So, let s go ahead and calculate  $21,780 divided by $59,488 gives a decimal. Multiplying that decimal by 100 will convert it into a percentage. Okay, let me do the math  (21,780   59,488)   100   about 36.61. So, there you have it, roughly 36.61% of the lease commitments were paid off in 2016. Huh, interesting. That seems like a significant chunk of the lease commitments right there paid in one year. To double-check, I quickly run through the calculations again to make sure everything adds up and yes, the numbers confirm it.

Question  what is the net change in reserve for future policy benefits during 2012  Answer ', 'input': 'Alright, let s figure out the net change in the reserve for future policy benefits for 2012. First, we need to look at what we started with at the beginning of the year. It says here that the balance was $67,187 thousand. Okay, got it. Now, I see there are some liabilities assumed. It looks like we added $126 thousand to our reserve from these assumed liabilities. Not a huge amount, but it s something. Oh, and we also have adjustments to the reserves. That s another $2,365 thousand added. These adjustments can be due to various reasons, but for our calculation, they just add to the total. Now comes the part where we need to subtract. It seems $3,571 thousand were paid out as benefits during the year. That s going to decrease our reserves. Finally, let s check what the balance is at the end of the year. The ending balance is $66,107 thousand. To figure out the net change, let s calculate it as the ending balance minus the beginning balance. So, $66,107 minus $67,187 gives us -$1,080 thousand. Let s just double-check that everything adds up correctly. If we take the beginning balance of $67,187, add the liabilities assumed ($126) and the reserve adjustments ($2,365), and then subtract the benefits paid ($3,571), yup, we do indeed end up with $66,107. So everything checks out  The net change in the reserve for future policy benefits during 2012 is a decrease of $1,080 thousand.', 'output': 'The net change in the reserve for future policy benefits during 2012 is a decrease of $1,080 thousand.'}\n",

Let s take a look at the numbers from that year. First, I see that the total net revenues for the institutional client services segment in 2012 were listed as $18,124 million. That s the big number we re working with. Now, what s the figure for equities client execution for the same year  It says here that they brought in $3,171 million in 2012. Pretty clear so far. To find out what chunk of the total this represents, I need to calculate the percentage. I ll take the equities revenues, which is $3,171 million, and divide it by the total net revenues of $18,124 million. Simple division. Let s do that math  $3,171 divided by $18,124 gives us a decimal. I ll multiply it by 100 to convert it into a percentage. So, I get approximately 17.50%. That means about 17.50% of the total net revenues in 2012 were from equities client execution. I ll just take a moment to make sure that all sounds right. Yep, it looks all good. So, I d say the answer is confirmed.', 'output': 'The equities client execution contributed approximately 17.50% to the total net revenues of the institutional client services segment in 2012.'}\n"
